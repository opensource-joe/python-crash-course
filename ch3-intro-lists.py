# A list is a collection of items in a particular order. Anything can be put in a list, the items in the list don't have to be related in any particular way. 
# A list usually contains more than one element, it's a good idea to make the name of your list plural. 
# Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by telling Python the position, or index, of the item desired.

# list
# bicycles = ["trek", "cannondale", "redline", "specialized"]
# print(bicycles)

# access list item with variable name followed by index = bicycles[0]
# print(bicycles[0])

# access the last item in the list, second to last, and so on
# print(bicycles[-1])
# print(bicycles[-2])

# using individual values from a list
# message = f"My first bicycle was a {bicycles[0].title()}"
# print(message)

# Exercises

# 3-1. Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.



# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

# 3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
